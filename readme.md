I'm a full-stack web developer, primarily working for the web on platforms such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and IBM's [XPages runtime](http://xpages.info/) on the [Domino server](http://www.ibm.com/software/products/ibmdomino) stack. I have a passion for automation, git, Linux, and building better apps. I'm also an Army veteran and between my military service and return to coding, I worked in emergency medicine as an EMT in northern Minnesota.

I'm [@edm00se](https://twitter.com/edm00se) on twitter, I blog on development topics at [edm00se.io](https://edm00se.io/).
