# Ask Me Anything

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

If you have questions for me, this is a way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means _virtually anything_. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever. Just nothing so crude I couldn't answer without my mother being able to read it.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question haven't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
